- the host can choose to either connect to spotify or apple music api.
- they can either login (connect with their own account) or not and just use the free preview of songs
- where can we securely store the api key if we make the calls from the frontend?
- the host selects different settings to choose from which poll to choose random songs. He can select or exclude music categories (like rock, pop...), select time spans (1990 - present) and so on. Feel free to come up with more ideas.
- the host can then define how many rounds to play
- there are different play modes. Guess the song title, artist, release year, release decade, producer and so on. We can come up with more later. The song in question will be played on the host. The other players including the host will see the question on their device and can enter their answer. There might be a time limit within which they have to enter their answer.
- show a cover of an album and the users must find out the band or album title
